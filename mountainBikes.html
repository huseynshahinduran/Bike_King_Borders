                The Aurum HSP C1’s High Single Pivot suspension relies on precision DH 
                kinematics and an idler pulley to ensure the suspension absorbs every 
                obstacle sitting between you and victory. 
                <br>
                The Aurum HSP’s full carbon DH frame is engineered to maximize strength, 
                optimize stiffness-to-weight ratio, and increase vibration damping to be 
                able to pick the fastest line and stick to it in practice, quali’s and the final run.

                The eWME should be very well-known by this season at the latest. 
                Awarded countless test approvals, praised by every editor, and 
                without any real weak points, there’s hardly anyone who doesn’t 
                know this e-bike right now. We’ve finetuned the range of models 
                once more and are again offering all wheel sizes, each in two price 
                ations. With 140/145 mm of travel on the 29” and MX models, and 160 
                mm of travel on the 27.5”, we’re offering the right bike for every situation.

                Strong material is used in tires and rims to ensure it is durable. All 
                other components are also strong and durable. There are special features 
                added to the countryside where there are jumps and unpaved roads all the way. 
                They are also fit for city roads where there are holes in the street and other 
                issues related to slums. These bikes are beneficial for all types of areas and 
                all types of people from young to adults.
